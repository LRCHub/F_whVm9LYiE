[00:09.18] Summer has come and passed
[00:13.87] The innocent can never last
[00:18.55] Wake me up when September ends
[00:33.55] 
[00:27.79] Like my father's come to pass
[00:32.03] Seven years has gone so fast
[00:36.77] Wake me up when September ends
[00:51.77] 
[00:45.96] Here comes the rain again
[00:50.55] Falling from the stars
[00:55.03] Drenched in my pain again
[00:59.45] Becoming who we are
[01:08.95] 
[01:04.34] As my memory rests
[01:08.40] But never forgets what I lost
[01:13.46] Wake me up when September ends
[01:28.46] 
[01:36.07] Summer has come and passed
[01:40.51] The innocent can never last
[01:45.18] Wake me up when September ends
[02:00.18] 
[01:54.35] Ring out the bells again
[01:58.81] Like we did when spring began
[02:03.73] Wake me up when September ends
[02:18.73] 
[02:12.71] Here comes the rain again
[02:17.47] Falling from the stars
[02:22.09] Drenched in my pain again
[02:26.19] Becoming who we are
[02:35.69] 
[02:31.09] As my memory rests
[02:35.32] But never forgets what I lost
[02:40.23] Wake me up when September ends
[02:55.23] 
[03:23.58] Summer has come and passed
[03:28.05] The innocent can never last
[03:32.64] Wake me up when September ends
[03:47.64] 
[03:41.80] Like my father's come to pass
[03:46.49] 20 years has gone so fast
[03:51.12] Wake me up when September ends
[04:06.12] 
[04:00.18] Wake me up when September ends
[04:09.45] Wake me up when September ends
