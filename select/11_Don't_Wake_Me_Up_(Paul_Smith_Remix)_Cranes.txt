Just to be dream so
Just to be feel so
Oh, I dream so
Oh, I feel so

Oh, I dream so
Oh, I feel so
Yeah, I dream so

Over and over
And over and over
And over and over we go

The sun is rising
High above me
Feeling like in Heaven, oh

The sun is rising
High above me
Feeling like in Heaven, oh

Don't wake me up
Don't wake me up
So don't wake me up
So don't wake me up
