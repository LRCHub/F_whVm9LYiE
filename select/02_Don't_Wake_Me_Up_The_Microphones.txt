I woke up before you and I watched you sleep,
I wanted to wake you up from dreams, I'm sure, were sweet
But you were awake
You were watching me
I heard your voice whispering with squinted eyes:
"Don't wake me up, I want to keep sleeping"
Please fall back asleep
"Don't wake me up"

Later, still in bed, we watched it get dark
I remember you fell asleep on my arm
While I looked off into the sky getting dark,
Saw your face formed in clouds
And you looked right at me and said:
"You just fell asleep, this is your dream
I'll be coming down soon, or you'll come up to me"
Don't wake me up
