Wake me up before I drop out on you
You treat me rough to show that you care
And I just can't refuse, baby if I had a promise from you
I'd get up and out of my bed instead I've been subdued

Wake me up before I drop out on you
The TV life is working alright, it feels so good to lose, baby
If I had a promise from you
I'd get up and out of my head instead I'm so confused

Let's sift through the haze of the past seven days
Moet in mud and a bottle of Bud and Monday looks divine
Let's trip through the maze away from everybody's gaze
Your vice like grip on my sherbet dip, I guess, I'll get in line

Was it just the margaritas or are you looking at me?
Without a fuss, youre getting us, ever so slightly messed up
Was it just the margaritas or are you talking to me?
Feels like I'm back at school, makes me want to break the rules

Wake me up before I drop out on you
You treat me rough to show that you care
And I just can't refuse, baby if I had a promise from you
I'd get up and out of my bed instead I've been subdued

Wake me up before I drop out on you
The TV life is working alright, it feels so good to lose, baby
If I had a promise from you
I'd get up and out of my head instead I'm so confused

You always were a dye in the wool
I always thought you were so cool
Never realized that you'd been shared
I think you're off your head

Dressed up and put on my make up
My best face just for you
It's sad to hear that you're still shook up
Now, you know what I can do

Don't waste your time
(Don't waste your time)
You know my passion is so yours and mine

Just read the signs
(Just read the signs)
Your passion belongs to me, myself and I

Wake me up before I drop out on you
You treat me rough to show that you care
And I just can't refuse, baby if I had a promise from you
I'd get up and out of my bed instead I've been subdued

Wake me up before I drop out on you
The TV life is working alright, it feels so good to lose baby
If I had a promise from you
I'd get up and out of my head instead I'm so confused

Don't waste your time
Don't waste your time
Just read the signs
