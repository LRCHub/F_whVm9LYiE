Wake me up before I drop out on you
You treat me rough to show that you care
And I just can't refuse, baby
If I had a promise from you
I'd get up and out of my bed
Instead I've been subdued

Wake me up before I drop out on you
The TV light is working alright
It feels so good to lose, baby
If I had a promise from you
I'd get up and out of my head
Instead I'm so confused

Let's sift through the haze of the past seven days
Moet in mud, a bottle of bud
And Monday looks divine
Let's trip through the maze, away from everybody's gaze
Your vice-like grip on my sherbet dip
I guess I'll get in line

Was it just the margaritas or are you lookin' at me?
Without a fuss, you're getting us every so slightly messed up
Was it just the margaritas or are you talkin' to me?
It feels like I'm back at school, makes me wanna break the rules

Wake me up before I drop out on you
You treat me rough to show that you care
And I just can't refuse, baby
If I had a promise from you
I'd get up and out of my bed
Instead I've been subdued

Wake me up before I drop out on you
The TV light is working alright
It feels so good to lose, baby
If I had a promise from you
I'd get up and out of my head
Instead I'm so confused

You always were a dye in the wool
You always thought that you were so cool
Never realised that you'd be shared
I think you're off your head

Dressed up and put on my makeup
My best face just for you
I'm sad to hear that you're still sugar
Now you know what I can do

Don't waste your time (don't waste your time)
You know my passion is to yours and mine
Just read the signs (just read the signs)
Your passion belongs to me, myself, and I

Wake me up before I drop out on you
You treat me rough to show that you care
And I just can't refuse, baby
If I had a promise from you
I'd get up and out of my bed
Instead I've been subdued

Wake me up before I drop out on you
The TV light is working alright
It feels so good to lose, baby
If I had a promise from you
I'd get up and out of my head
Instead I'm so confused

Don't waste your time
Don't waste your time
Just read the signs
